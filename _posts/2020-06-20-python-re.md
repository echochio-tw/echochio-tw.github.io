Finding Numbers in a Haystack

In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. 
You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.

```

```
import re, requests
r = requests.get('http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_694846.txt')
print (sum([ int(x) for x in re.findall('([0-9]+)',r.text)]))
```
